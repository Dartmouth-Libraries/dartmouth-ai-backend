Welcome to Dartmouth AI's documentation!
========================================

Dartmouth AI is a Python library that compiles many Open Source Machine Learning and AI tools in a single package. The goal is to offer powerful tools with a common, straight-forward interface.
Many tools at `https://ai.dartmouth.edu <https://ai.dartmouth.edu>`_ are powered by this library.

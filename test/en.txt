The Battle of Inverkeithing was fought on 20 July 1651 between England and Scotland. As part of the political turmoil of the English Civil War, an English army under Oliver Cromwell invaded Scotland in July 1650 and heavily defeated a Scottish army commanded by David Leslie at the Battle of Dunbar. The Scots withdrew to Stirling, a choke point. For nearly a year the English failed to storm or bypass Stirling, or to draw the Scots out into another battle. On 17 July 1651 an English force crossed the Firth of Forth at its narrowest point in flat-bottomed boats and landed at North Queensferry. The Scots sent forces to pen the English in, and the English reinforced their landing. On 20 July the Scots moved against the English and in a short engagement were routed. The English seized the deep-water port of Burntisland. Cromwell then shipped over most of the English army, marched on and captured Perth, the temporary seat of the Scottish government, cutting off supplies for the Scottish army.
